*******Static Comp 2
In this project we were given a comp and expected to replicate the same layout.
We were given creative license to choose text, images, and color palette.
The layout of the header was the biggest challenge. Making the site responsive was
also a big challenge but in the end I was able to achieve the positioning that I wanted.
